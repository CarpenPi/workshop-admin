# Contributing

This document is a modified version of the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/swcarpentry/git-novice/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md) 
from [Software Carpentries](https://software-carpentry.org).

This is an open source project, and we welcome contributions of all kinds:
new feature implementations,
fixes to existing material,
and bug reports are all welcome.

## Contributor Agreement

By contributing,
you agree that we may redistribute your work under [our license](LICENSE.md).
In exchange,
we will address your issues and/or assess your change proposal as promptly as we can,
and help you become a member of our community.

## How to Contribute

The easiest way to get started is to file an issue
to tell us about a spelling mistake,
some awkward wording,
or a factual error.
This is a good way to introduce yourself
and to meet some of our community members.

1.  If you have a [GitHub](https://github.com) account,
    or are willing to create one,
    but do not know how to use Git,
    you can report problems or suggest improvements by creating an issue.
    This allows us to assign the item to someone
    and to respond to it in a threaded discussion.

3.  If you are comfortable with Git,
    and would like to add or change material,
    you can submit a pull request (PR).
    Instructions for doing this are [included below](#using-github).

## What to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute,
from implementing new features and improving existing ones
to updating or filling in the documentation
and submitting [bug reports][new-issue]
about things that don't work, aren't clear, or are missing.
If you are looking for ideas,
please see [the list of issues for this repository][issues].

Comments on issues and reviews of pull requests are just as welcome:
we are smarter together than we are on our own.
Reviews from novices and newcomers are particularly valuable:
it's easy for people who have been using these lessons for a while
to forget how impenetrable some of this material can be,
so fresh eyes are always welcome.

## Using GitHub

If you choose to contribute via GitHub,
you may want to look at
[How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub][how-contribute].
In brief:

We use [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) to manage changes:
    1.  Create a new branch in your desktop copy of this repository for each significant change.
    2.  Commit the change in that branch.
    3.  Push that branch to your fork of this repository on GitHub.
    4.  Submit a pull request from that branch to the [master repository][repo].
    5.  If you receive feedback,
        make changes on your desktop and push to your branch on GitHub:
        the pull request will update automatically.
