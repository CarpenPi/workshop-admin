# workshop-admin
Admin system for carpentry workshops.

## Aim:
The purpose of this software is to help with the organisation of Carpentries 
Workshops. 

## Technology:
It is written in Java and will require a database in the background 
which will default to sqlite.

## Audience:
The software is aimed at Carpentries workshop hosts, organisers, instructors and helpers.

## Features:
The software will provide a way to capture learners, helpers, instructors and 
organisers. It will assist in the sending of emails and recording presence at 
workshops.

A GUI will be developed that will either be web based or as a Java application 
or both. Ideally the software should be able to run as an application and as
 a webservice that can be synchronised.
